Task 1. 
The input needed to calculate the gradient were loss and parameters due to us calculating the gradient of the loss with regards to our input parameters.

Task 2.
The math for the dense layer. We multiplied the 28*28 vector giving us 784 inputs. To get the dense layer the inputs needed to be multiplied with the number of neurons which is 128. 784*128 = 100352. However, since we also needed to add one parameter for the line intercept constant it amounted to 100352 + 128 = 100480.

Task 3.
